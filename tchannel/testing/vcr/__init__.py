``tchannel.testing.vcr`` provides VCR-like functionality for TChannel. Its
API is heavily inspired by the `vcrpy <https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy/>`_
library.

This allows recording TChannel requests and their responses into YAML files
during integration tests and replaying those recorded responses when the tests
are run next time.

The simplest way to use this is with the :py:func:`use_cassette` function.

.. autofunction:: use_cassette

Configuration
-------------

.. py:data:: tchannel.testing.vcr.DEFAULT_MATCHERS

    A tuple containing the default list of matchers used by
    :py:func:`tchannel.testing.vcr.use_cassette`.

Record Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: RecordMode

"""

from __future__ import absolute_import

from .config import use_cassette
from .record_modes import RecordMode
from .cassette import DEFAULT_MATCHERS


__all__ = ['use_cassette', 'RecordMode', 'DEFAULT_MATCHERS']
