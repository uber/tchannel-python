        connections with your application. These connections are used to load
        balance inbound and outbound requests to other applications on the
        Hyperbahn network.

        Re-advertisement happens periodically after calling this method (every
        minute). Hyperbahn will eject us from the network if it doesn't get a
        re-advertise from us after 5 minutes.

        This function may be called multiple times if it fails. If it
        succeeds, all consecutive calls are ignored.

        :param list routers:
            A seed list of known Hyperbahn addresses to attempt contact with.
            Entries should be of the form ``"host:port"``.

        :param string name:
            The name your application identifies itself as. This is usually
            unneeded because in the common case it will match the ``name`` you
            initialized the ``TChannel`` instance with. This is the identifier
            other services will use to make contact with you.

        :param timeout:
            The timeout (in sec) for the initial advertise attempt.
            Defaults to 30 seconds.

        :param jitter:
            Variance allowed in the interval per request. Defaults to 5
            seconds.  The jitter applies to the initial advertise request as
            well.

        :param router_file:
            The host file that contains the routers information. The file
            should contain a JSON stringified format of the routers parameter.
            Either routers or router_file should be provided. If both provided,
