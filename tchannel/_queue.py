    #
    # _get and _put are futures maintaining pointers to a linked list of
    # futures. The linked list is implemented as Node objects holding the
    # value and the next future.
    #
    #     Node
    #   +---+---+   +---+---+  E: Empty future
    #   | 1 | F-|-->| 2 | E |  F: Filled future
    #   +---+---+   +---+---+
    #         ^           ^
    #   +---+ |     +---+ |
    #   | F-|-+     | F-|-+
    #   +---+       +---+
    #    _get        _put
    #
    # When there's a put, we fill the current empty future with a Node
    # containing the value and a pointer to the next, newly created empty
    # future.
